1. You have 2 options for what you can pass in to a
   state setter function (e.g. `setCount`). What are they?
   i can pass updated value of the state or an callback function with the procedures to work with the state


2. When would you want to pass the first option (from answer
   above) to the state setter function?
   whenever i want the state to be easily updated and i don't wanna access the old value


3. When would you want to pass the second option (from answer
   above) to the state setter function?
	when i wanna acces the previous or old value to make modification and changes to it
